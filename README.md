Almost There is a crowdfunding platform based on [NEAR](https://near.org/) and hosted on [Sia](https://siasky.net/). Users can both create new Almost There "campaigns", or donate to one. Each campaign is also created as their own webpage (also hosted on Sia), that the users can link and promote on their own. The campaigns have a date of closing and donations goal. When the date is reached, if the goal was achieved or surpassed, the donations are sent to the campaign owner; if not, the donations are returned to the donors.

# How does it work?

Almost There is a web application, and as with most web apps, it has a frontend and a backend. The frontend is a traditional HTML5 page, hosted on Sia. The backend is a smart contract hosted in the NEAR Network (currently only testnet).

While the frontend takes care of the look and feel and templating of the campaigns, the backend handles the account management and donations.
